    "### What is a Maclaurin Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Maclaurin series is a way of decompressing a Sine wave, into a large set of sums. It can be shown as the following, with the first few values evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "![maclaurin series evaluated](http://www.mathwords.com/m/m_assets/maclaurin_art_examples.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this for a programatic sense, **numerator = 1 on odd inputs, and numerator = 0 on even inputs** which is then simply denominated by the factorial of the input - followed by x to the power of the factorial. This means we can quickly construct an equation if we are using the first 3 inputs, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this project is to come up with point values in a data set that we require, and train the network to move towards those peaks and reward areas to come up with a \"perfect\" curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals for the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to scale to N amount of input sinal changes\n",
    "- Able to run through x-values to produce a predicted set of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "After some evaluation, I've deemed this a very difficult project - as the amount of inputs varies quite tremendously from test to test, so this will be me trying to work on the effectiveness of 3 predicted inputs that can be completely random from 1-26."
