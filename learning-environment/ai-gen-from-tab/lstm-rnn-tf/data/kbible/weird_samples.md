#First "weird" sample

"32:4 I spiram that the kight of the pleads of his plools: so they
come, and the LORD Alah that the discimed
the flesh, I magony that he nothife: 2:6 As a thang up of
Meremies sigres, 4:11 fur it the sefor friangellow, Roriou, and
there stanke"

##What's weird?

The word "Alah" which showed up, which "alah" shows up in the text, though
with no capital letter. The LSTM RNN uses a pattern recognition that is rather
sensitive, so there would be a reason for this being outputted. "alah" comes
up as "Calah", though that is it. "LORD" and "Calah" never come side-by-side.

Really suspicious, and interesting. But I am sure it's nothing.

## Some other quotes:

"122:1 The sons of their man: and the just saad."

"12:2 Yet are with, and a let ye end."

"6:18 They wildeth his house in the tons coverver thy Fath."
