## (Fluffy) HSC - Art 12 - Jack Hales

17-year-old developer with ambitions to become a world-class developer. Blending my passion for programming with my love for art, to create my final-year major work that explores the idea: **who made the artwork, the artist, or the artwork?**. The robot's goal is to be able to decifer it's environment in a internet-disabled environment and push them into the computer's memory and blending it with A.I. and complex algorithm processes to create an artwork that is unique to that time, place, and audience that perceived it's creation.
